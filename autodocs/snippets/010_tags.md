## Tags

Tags can be imported from the `tags` function, whereby each tag is a function that takes a list of other tags or text.

There's a minimal selector function `S` available as well. Look at it as a replacement for the `$` fucntion in jQuery, but simpler.

The `add` function can be used to add a list of (nested) children to a DOM element (e.g. `document.body`).
