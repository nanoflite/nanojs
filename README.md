# nanojs - (dom, state, router, model, component, utils)

*A minimal reactive framework, (some) batteries included*

nanojs is a lightweight framework designed to provide essential reactive programming features for web applications. Its minimalistic approach allows developers to efficiently manage state and DOM updates with simplicity and ease.

## Key Features

- **Reactive State Management**: Easily manage application state with reactive state objects. Changes to the state automatically update the DOM elements bound to them, keeping the user interface in sync with the data.
- **Derived States**: Compute values based on state changes using derived states. This feature helps in efficiently managing computations that depend on multiple reactive states.
- **Component System**: Build reusable and encapsulated components, allowing for well-structured and maintainable code.
- **Declarative DOM Manipulation**: Use functions and reactive expressions to declaratively build and manipulate the DOM. This promotes clean code and reduces boilerplate.
- **Router with Hash-based Navigation**: Includes a simple router for managing hash-based navigation, making it easy to build single-page applications with route handling.
- **Utility Functions**: Handy utility functions like asynchronous sleep and property binding, which simplify common tasks in web development.

nanojs aims to provide a streamlined development experience with a focus on reactivity and functional component design, making it an ideal choice for developers looking for a simple, reactive framework.
